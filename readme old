# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their annual income and spending behavior in order to identify distinct customer groups for targeted business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic and purchasing behavior data including:
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- MySQL (SQL queries and data analysis)
- Power BI (planned)

## Project Workflow
1. Performed data analysis and customer segmentation using K-Means clustering in Python.
2. Exported the processed data and loaded it into a MySQL database.
3. Executed SQL queries to analyze customer distribution, income levels, and spending patterns across clusters.

## Key Insights
- Identified distinct customer segments based on income and spending behavior.
- Recognized high-value customer groups for targeted marketing.
- Analyzed demographic distribution across customer clusters.
